# KoplokStation

A meteor web app that I plan on running on my server when I have one someday.

This app has no real function; it's here for no reason and looks really cringy. Just like my life.

### Components

- Basic authentication on every route to restrict people from messing with this app.
- A web scraper to get the list of connected devices from the router's web interface page, for whatever function it may possibly serve.
- A button that can send beep and **TELOLET noises** to the server by making it play the sound files using mpg123. I figured that I can use this to spook my mother from outside the house.
- A file upload system using CollectionFS for storing stuff on the server.
- A pseudo-terminal that can be used to send console commands. This sounds like a bad idea so I decided to take it off the page, but I still kept the component files and API in the project.

### Does it work?

Kinda
